# Text-Based-Emotion-Classifier using BERT
Text Based Emotion Classifier using BERT fine tuning approaches
In this Project, the BERT Fine-Tuning and Feature based approaches were considered for Text Emotion classification. Six different emotions from the text are classified using
the proposed model which includes surprise, love, joy, fear, sadness, and anger. The dataset for these emotions is taken from the publicly available source and preprocessed properly. With the fine-tuning approach, Bert base models, Bert-LSTM
models, and Bert-BiLSTM models are analyzed. In the Feature based approach, the BERT embeddings are passed to CNN for classification. It is found that the BERT pre-trained model finetuned with LSTM layers is the best model in terms of accuracy,
precision, and recall with 94.7%, 84.5%, and 83.45% respectively.
